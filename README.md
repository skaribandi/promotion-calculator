Promotion Calculator to calculate based on the applicable promotion for the cart items 

Assumptions :

1.At any given cart only one promotion can be applied 
2.We can have different themes to select the promotions based on organizations goals ex : More discount to the user , less discount to the user , 
Random promotion  but I have chosen the client will select what promotion they want to apply 
3.Client class or main class will create the product / cartItems/ Cart  (** NOTE** I count add the Client class but added the UT to test all the changes ) 
	Clarification : I am not sure what do you mean by product &  price should be configurable ? 
4.I assume that from input file we should be able to load the product details .
